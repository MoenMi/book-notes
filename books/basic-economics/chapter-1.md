# 1 - What is Economics?

In this introduction to the book, Sowell lays out some of the fundamental concepts of economics. Sowell introduces his perspective that economic events tend to be uncomplicated but political rhetoric and jargon make these events seem "murky" (1).

Sowell settles on the definition of economics given by British economist Lionel Robbins: "Economics is the study of the use of scarce resources which have alternative uses."

Then, Sowell provides simple descriptions of scarcity and productivity, showing that complexity to an economy via multiple uses for resources (e.g. petroleum produces gasoline, plastics, asphalt, etc.), efficiency in production, and the dynamic needs and wants of the consumers in an economy.

Lastly, Sowell argues that to understand the consequences of economic decisions, you should look at the incentives they create while ignoring the goals they pursue. Additionally, one should understand that economics involves many areas in the realm of decision-making and should not be confined to just the realm money.
