# 2 - The Role of Prices

In this chapter, Sowell argues that an economy allocates its resources through pricing. He contrasts the effects pricing has in planned economies as opposed to those in freer economies. 

### Economic Decision Making

According to Sowell, price determines how much of each resource gets used where and how products get to people. Additionally, prices convey underlying realities of resource availability in an economy, as the example of beach-front housing illustrates. This process causes natural resources to move from places where they are abundant to places where they are needed. Due to the complexity of this system, planned economies require too many decisions to be made to have a governing body set prices manually.
